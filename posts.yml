    - Read the image---27% isn't as much as I would have expected. It's both a good thing and a bad thing. It's a good thing, of course, because a lower percentage here means fewer tons of CO₂. It's a bad thing because electricity is currently the source of emissions for which I would say we have the most ideas (and the most promising ideas) for reducing emissions---and we'd like those ideas to address as much of the problem as possible. However, as humankind makes electricity generation both cleaner and cheaper, and as we seek to reduce other sectors' emissions, electricity generation will cover more and more industry activities for which we currently burn fossil fuels. That's a good thing.

  text: The U.S. Energy Information Administration considers hydroelectricity to be carbon neutral. Researchers find that decomposing plant matter caused by the dammed waters emit 25% more methane than previously thought---a billion tons or 1.3% of human-caused greenhouse gases annually. The research presents opportunities for designing and locating dams to mitigate this effect.

    title: Hydroelectric dams are (theoretically) carbon-neutral.
    content:
      - However, depending on where it is constructed, building a dam can pollute---for <b>half a century or more</b>---the equivalent over 1 ton of CO_2 per megawatt of electricity generated.
      - Flooding an area for a dam can release methane produced in high-carbon soil.
      - That's not including the 1 ton of CO_2 per ton of cement used in the dam.
      - However, hydro is always an opportunity, and <i>pump-back</i> hydroelectric dams are a unique opportunity for storing massive amounts of energy.

    - The AAPowerLink encompasses what is planned to be the world's largest solar farm, largest battery, and longest submarine HVDC cable---a three-point innovation in renewable generation, storing intermittent power, and getting it from where it's produced to where it needs to be. The Australian-manufactured solar farm in Australia's Northern Territory would have a 20-gigawatt capacity---comparable to Ontario's power consumption---and would deliver up to over two gigawatts to Singapore and, later on, Indonesia. As of 2015, Singapore was 95% natural-gas-powered. This project would lower Singapore's CO₂ emissions by 6 million tonnes.
    - What impresses me most about this project is how the natural resource being `mined' isn't exactly land, solar, or solar panels. More or less, these three resources are theoretically available everywhere. The resource being taken advantage of is the intersection of all three of these. Proximity definitely isn't one of them.

    title: Using wind and solar in unfavorable climates calls for building more transmission lines from sunnier, windier locations.
    content:
      - Like building a 4200-kilometer undersea transmission line from sunny, spacious Australia all the way to Singapore? That would be the <i>Australia--Asia PowerLink</i>.
      - Announced earlier last year, the transmission line will supply up to <b>15% of Singapore's electricity</b> by 2027, and will be the longest submarine HVDC cable in the world. HVDC stands for high-voltage <em>direct-current</em>---the opposite of how we transmit large amounts of power over comparably short distances.
      - When countries work together, everyone prospers.

    title: Any realistic scenario of running a city on solar has a plan for the winter.
    content:
      - Be it firing up a fossil-fuel plant (though not without carbon capture) or starting up a nuclear plant, big batteries to save summer energy for the winter aren't yet going to cut it. Not at the dirt-cheap price we're used to paying for electricity.
      - This is most challenging in places far from the Earth's equator, where less sunlight usually hits solar panels less directly in winter.
      - Wind power similarly experiences seasonal highs and lows that we must be eager to deal with.

    - Energiewende is German for Energy Turnaround, and refers not only to GHG-emissions-free but renewable sources of electricity---not nuclear. Germany's last three nuclear plants will shut down this year and coal plants as late as 2038. The program sets a goal of 80--95% GHG reduction by 2050 too, albeit relative to 1990 levels, already achieving 27% reduction as of 2014.
    - In my opinion, nuclear is required to practically be able to achieve net zero by 2050, especially in countries with harsher winters. Fissile material, while not renewable, should be considered an option alongside renewable sources of energy.

      - The fact that this is considered ambitious is a good thing---it means that people are more than willing to try.
      - However, it is also a bad thing---it means that others don't believe this goal is attainable. But this goal must be attainable, because it is <em>necessary</em>. As humanity, we must reach as close to <b>net-zero emissions</b> as humanly possible. We need to act as quickly as possible.
      - Germany, for example, increased its solar capacity <b>six-fold</b> in a two-year span. And that was a decade ago.

  text: Wind turbines are incredible pieces of technology. Both wind turbines and solar cells use a technique called Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) to maximize power output under different environmental conditions. Higher turbine speeds and cell voltages don't always mean more power---torque and electrical current also play a part.
  post_image:
    title: Wind turbines are shut down to stop cyclones from tearing them apart.
    content:
      - The weather can't be controlled (save for climate change)---but wind turbines sure can be.
      - Left to spin freely, they won't always extract maximum power from the wind. But by controlling their speed---even spinning more slowly---wind turbines <b>maximize their power output</b>.
      - Solar does the same thing. But how do you change how quickly your solar panel spins? (You don't.) Your solar setup changes its voltage to steal as much power as possible from the sun. That's before converting it to what eventually powers your TV, of course.

  text: This is incredible. The global population has boomed in the past 27 years, but it hasn't increased by 50%. Compare that to the ~200% (three-fold) increase in global electricity consumption in the past 27 years. The global electricity supply will have to increase up to three-fold again in the coming 27 years that lead us up to the 2050 climate goal---not accounting for the population growth in that time, which the UN estimates at ~15%. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but electrification is worth every dollar.

  post_image:
    title: Generation is always less than capacity.
    content:
      - <b>Capacity</b> is how much power you <em>can</em> produce. For wind turbines, it's how much you produce when the wind's blowing the hardest in the right direction. For dust-free solar panels at the right temperature, it's when sunshine's hitting them at the best angle on a clear, sunny day.
      - <b>Generation</b> is how much power you <em>do</em> produce. This especially matters for renewables, like wind and solar, which only generate electricity about 25--40% of the time anyway.
      - But wind turbines and solar panels have been getting more and more efficient for decades.

      - Rather than continuing to use the technologies that make oil and gas so cheap, we can redeploy them to make it easier, safer, and more efficient to find and drill new geothermal wells.
      - We should advance similar efforts to make renewable and carbon-free generation similarly inexpensive.

    title: <b>Grid-scale batteries</b> would power entire cities.
    content:
      - Though it is difficult to greatly improve the batteries we have now and grid-scale batteries are only in development, the idea behind grid-scale batteries is to save extra electricity generated from renewables in the summer for the winter. Or for times of poor weather, storms, or natural disasters.
      - For instance, large <b>flow batteries</b> with even larger fuel tanks can scale well to deliver a lot of energy quickly. This year, China started operating the largest vanadium flow battery---weighing in at 400 MWh.

    title: <b>Pumped hydro</b> is currently the best, most realistic way of storing city-level amounts of energy.
    content:
      - It works like a two-way hydroelectric dam, but it doesn't need a natural river system.
      - When there is a surplus of cheap electricity, like from wind or solar, it's used to pump massive amounts of water up a hill into a reservoir for storage. When there isn't enough electricity, the water is released to spin a turbine, re-generating about 3/4 of the electricity that went in.
      - However, pumped hydro reservoirs are usually smaller than hydroelectric dams and for the daily rather than the seasonal storage that's called for by wind and solar.

    title: <b>Hydrogen fuel cells</b> are a potential alternative to grid-scale batteries and pumped hydro.
    content:
      - Extra wind or solar could be used to generate cheap, clean hydrogen from water through a process called <i>electrolysis</i>.
      - We could store and ship the hydrogen where it's needed.
      - When there isn't enough renewable electricity, the hydrogen can be slowly burned in a fuel cell, producing nothing but electricity and water.
      - However, hydrogen is difficult to store in tight spaces without losing any, and much of it is produced with a carbon footprint for testing fuels cells---which are expensive but still being improved.

    title: "Hydrogen:<br>The electric fuel."
    content:
      - Fossil fuels' appeal was that lots of portable energy could be moved---by ship, train, truck, or pipeline---from where they're produced to where they're used. But that's like distributing electricity in the form of battery chemicals and throwing them away when spent. (Or, less wastefully, returning them to be recharged.)
      - Awful yet convenient, we can't do that with raw electricity and move it from one place to another on the fly---we need a power grid
      - But if we generate clean hydrogen, we might be able to ship and store it all we like.

    title: <b>Point capture</b> devices are installed in fossil- fuel-burning power plants to absorb around 90% of CO_2 emissions.
    content:
      - About 10% of coal plant emissions are CO_2.
      - Unfortunately, carbon capture devices are expensive, despite having existed for decades.
      - Plant operators have no incentive to use them without policies on energy and greenhouse gas emissions.
      - We need more of these kinds of private and government policies to mitigate the impact of existing energy solutions in the short term until cleaner, long-term solutions are put into place.

    title: Direct air capture devices will likely be vital for achieving net-zero carbon emissions.
    content:
      - A National Academy of Sciences study determined that we will need to directly capture and store around <b>10 billion tons of CO_2</b> by about 2050 and 20 billion tons 50 years after that---far in the future and yet approaching quickly.
      - This will be a challenge because direct air capture's advantage in flexibility and portability is also to its detriment.
      - The devices are inherently inefficient, being in an atmosphere of low CO_2 concentrations rather than fossil fuel plants' high concentrations of CO_2 emissions.

    content:
      - It's worth it to achieve 100% emissions-free electricity.
      - But the demand for electricity will have to increase quickly to make up for worse-polluting industries and for meeting the needs of an ever-increasing population.
      - To make it more possible, we should all cut back on our electricity use where we can. We must follow initiatives to use more electricity when it's cheapest to generate---such as by wind and solar---rather than expecting coal plants to fire up in the evening in developed countries.

      - An average Kenyan, for instance, generates less than 2% as much CO_2 as an average American or Canadian. Yet a Kenyan farmer's livelihood will be far more heavily impacted by a changing climate than those with a surplus of income to cope with the adverse affects of climate change.
      - We need to create new technologies and find new applications for existing ones, not only to stop developed societies from falling into poverty, but to <b>help lift developing communities out of poverty, sustainably</b>.

      - Agricultural research organizations are tools that enable growing more food in increasingly harsh conditions, while improving nutrition and farmers' livelihoods in developing communities.
      - For instance, the Consultive Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) creates better plant genetics and produces stronger varieties of staple crops, like the wheat we consume, and flood- and drought-resistant rice and corn.

    - This ambition of colonizing Mars demonstrates carelessness towards Earth and an empty promise to the vast majority of its population who would never be able to afford interplanetary relocation. Instead, we must invest our hope in our beautiful planet.
    - This is an example of where we should not be asking ``Is it cool?'' but rather, ``Is it GOOD?''---to which a ``No'' is very easy to argue. Feel free to check my math.
    - "Side note: Some say atmospheric carbon absorbed from Direct Air Capture (DAC) can be used to generate fuels, but DAC will not be viable compared to reducing emissions In the first place, especially when the absorbed carbon is just going to be burned again."

      - The SpaceX Starship booster burns 4.6 tonnes of methane fuel, releasing 13 tonnes of CO_2 into our atmosphere...
      - Every...
      - Second.
    content:
      - That's as much CO_2 per second as 3 million cars, or 6000 commercial airliners.
      - By its first stage separation 160 seconds later, Starship's booster has already polluted 2000 tonnes of CO_2. That's not including massive amounts of water vapor it creates in the atmosphere, which has a stronger GHG effect. Nor does it consider the Starship's second-stage spacecraft (pictured).
      - SpaceX plans launching each Starship over 1000 times per year, in a fleet of 1000, to entertain its ill-conceived goal of colonizing Mars. With the numbers at hand, this corresponds to 3 billion tonnes of CO_2 per year---or a shocking 6% of humanity's current annual CO_2 emissions.

    content:
      - A supposed selling point of BCLNG is that it will displace coal-fired plants in Asia.
      - One of the best rules of thumb against this (and similar pro-BCLNG arguments) it is that most people didn't appear to care about emissions from Asia until the discovery that BC had a way to make the oil and gas industry a lot of money.
      - The oil and gas industry didn't go looking for a solution to coal-fired plants in Asia. They (mainly Shell) looked for money, and used coal-fired plants in Asia as an excuse for taking that money at great cost to the environment.

      - "The answer won't surprise you: It's not."
      - While the installation costs are similar, the Brattle Group concluded that the long-term cost per kWh from solar farms is about half as much as for rooftop solar.
      - "That being said, solar is cheaper than ever. Other considerations include:"
      - <b>Aesthetics</b>. Rooftop solar looks great.
      - <b>Land use</b>. Solar farms take up space, although agrivoltaics seeks to counter this.
      - <b>Maintenance</b>. Solar farms are more convenient to repair.

    title: When demand exceeds supply, the frequency of the electrical grid decreases.
    content:
      - Normally, the grid operates at 60 Hz (or 50 Hz in Europe).
      - But what if the demand for electricity is lower than the supply? Then this frequency will decrease, as turbines and generators slow down to temporarily produce more power---signalling that more generation must be brought online.
      - But power plants are not designed to operate at different frequencies, so if more generation is unavailable, then load-shedding programs must be used to re-balance the grid.
