# *Energy, Renewables, and Fighting Climate Change*

This page accompanies a series of interesting, significant, and actionable facts and pieces of information about energy, renewables, and fighting climate change. The series also includes pieces of news, and relevant projects being worked on around the world. The series is as much about actionable advice and ways of looking at and addressing the problem of climate change as it is about the statistics and technical aspects of the problem.

The intended audience of the series is you! Chances are, you're a human living on planet Earth. You (almost without a doubt) are a contributor to climate change and play a role (albeit a small one â€” probably) in its driving forces. This is the case whether you know it or not, and whether you ignore it or try to have a positive impact. But this means that you can choose to try to mitigate the causes of climate change and help others to do the same by openly discussing the topic and ways to address it.

I will try to post new items in the series to all of the following social media sites:
- LinkedIn
- Twitter
- Instagram
- Reddit

An archive of previous posts will be made available.

The series strives to be as factually accurate, interesting (though not at the cost of accuracy), and meaningful as possible.
However, it is naturally biased toward my goal of trying to mitigate climate change as best I can and in a few different ways, one of which is discussing the topic through this series. Furthermore, I am naturally biased because I work at a tech company (albeit a small one) in the renewable energy industry.

I am greatly inspired by Bill Gates' book *How to Avoid a Climate Disaster*. (Though I am by no means advertising it.)
